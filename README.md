## User stories

#1. As a user I want a site where I can post and share photos

Just a thought.  But I'd really like a cool online branded site where
I can put up old photos and date them and share them.  Not loads, just
the odd one from a great experience or with people I care about.

The thing is, I'm only just really understanding the value of putting
photos online in terms of how they help build your identity and how
they can be helpful when your memory starts to fade.

I don't want to use facebook as that sort of feels a bit showy, and I
find the whole situation with 'likes' a bit cringy.  I don't want to
feel that a pic I care about isn't great because no one commented or
liked it, I just want it safe, online and available for me and others
to look at it if we want to.  Also facebook won't let you back data
photos.

I thought of instagram - but the whole point of that is that its
instant which means I can't backdate it and I don't want to ruin
actual moments by thinking I have to immediately share my pic.


#2. As a user I want to control what, who and when I share.

I also don't want just to use a plain photo site as there is a part of
me that does want anyone snooping on me online to see what a great
life I have and how happy I am.  It frustrates me that the only
measures of this at the moment are things like facebook likes and
comments.

Is there anything out there that could help me feel better about, and
get more control back, of my online identity?

There is a lot of research about why facebook etc is bad for your
mental health.  Maybe we can look at why that is, take out those
factors and look at adding things in that improve wellbeing.  I would
pay at least £1 a month for that.  I am not alone in my struggles with
facebook - but its the only option in many ways.


#3. As a user I want to control how my information is displayed

Why "cool online branded site"?   I suppose it doesn't have to be, but
just so it looks like a viable alternative.

Why "old photos"? Because I have a lot of old photos that are just
lying around that represent a big part of who I am and what I've done.

Why "date them"? I guess they don't have to be dated.  I just think
old photos are sometimes looked down upon unless they look like they
were added at the time and was wondering if there was a way not to
make this a factor.

Why "share them"? Maybe they are not shared - just easy to find if
someone is looking for them.  Perhaps integrated with fb if someone
did want to share them.  People could have unique usernames for our
service they add to twitter, fb, instagram etc if they want to.

Why "just the odd one from a great experience"? I don't want to
bombard people - I just want to give a taster that I am in control of.
Too many pics and everyone looses interest.  If we limit the amount,
then it might be like twitter for photos.

Why "not loads"? Loads of photos is too much back to showing people
holiday photos in an album - dated, and you loose people with the
sheer numbers.

What do you mean, "safe, online and available for me and others to
look at it if we want to" - what is safe?  what is "if want to"?  Safe
as in, you know they are all somewhere they won't get lost - maybe you
can upload loads, but only ever have a key batch showing publicly.

What do you mean by backdate?  I can look back through my instagram,
it does keep a history.  What if you have a photo from a time period
that wasn't on your phone - can you put it in your timeline?

What is "thinking I have to immediately share my pic"?  Sometimes, you
don't want to share a pic till after the event.  You might not be
psychologically ready to share it then and there, you are too busy
enjoying yourself.  I don't use instagram though, so maybe its not
like this...

"only measures of this at the moment are things like facebook likes
and comments"...so you want show selectively what a great life you
have by a different measure?  If not that what measure?  Maybe
something based on intrinsic rather than extrinsic motivation - you
choose personal goals somehow and collect personal achievements.

Is the problem you're trying to solve is getting back in control of
your online identity so that you can feel better about it? Yes, so
that it is more inline with who I really am/want to be.  The closer
these are aligned the better someone feels.

Cool.  I guess that is the core functionality, so there is no visible
log of when something was shared, what matters is it is being shared
now, with these people.  The sharing is enough, no-one else cannot
publicly judge you - i.e. edit, amend of like/comment.

However, would be good to have option to share publicly and on other
social media sites if you wanted to - (I'd love to have a photo album
that was more meaningful to me - free from the pressure of likes,
comments and tagging -  linked to from my facebook profile page, maybe
you could have a developer portfolio link on linkedin.)

It would also be great if you could store all your stuff there and it
was easy to make different portfolios up to be shared with different
groups.  I guess ideally the app could interface between existing
places people put stuff all around the web e.g. flickr, youtube,
photobox, google cloud etc and search engines and social networks as
well as having its own online presence.

I would love if you made this - I'd def use it.


#4. As a user I want to remember who I've shared with so that I can easily share with them again.

Sorry, I am getting a bit carried away now, but just need to get this
out.... (I am trying going without my thyroid med for a bit - I hope
all this manic thinking isn't a sign I'm overactive again!;))

The option to join with other to make joint identities/portfolios
would be very useful too - I guess this is what you were thinking of
doing for businesses.  I know from speaking to Ben that media
companies could use this sort of thing to brief journalists.

Maybe there could be a philanthropic side too somehow as it can help
people adapt/create new identities/focus on different aspects of
themselves after grief, illness, redundancy, dare I say it - prison
etc.

I was thinking about what we were talking about the other day and what
it is I'd really like and I think its a cool way of myself and other
people viewing my photos that represent my life.  I'd like to be able
to select a picture from each year of my life and display it in a cool
way, so I and others could flick through it and get a taste of my
life.

My mum always says, you don't remember things unless you have photos
and I want to remember, but I also want to have complete control over
what I choose to remember.

So I suppose what I was really talking about was a shareable photo
album diary that I can choose the pictures for, the dates for and
share with who ever I wanted however I wanted.  So, for example, I
might have photos for every year of my life that I choose to share on
FB but lots of photos for one particular day I choose to share with
specific people, then a few on my favourites that I want to be
publicly available on the internet.

Its about filtering and sharing my life history in a way that
optimises my mental welbeing both now and in the future.

Just an idea.  Thanks for reading;)







So links to content must depend on the following:
-user initial location or perscribed location
-user initial time of viewing or precribed time
-user initial machine or prescried machine
-user initial login or prescribed login
-user initial face recognition or presribed face recognition

Posts can:
-time out
-be groups of posts


UX intuitively allows user to set conditions for link:
-use snap chat like hidden controls such as swipes








# lumX

## Quick start

Three quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release][release].
- Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/lumapps/lumx.git.

## Documentation

lumX's documentation, included in this repo in the demo directory, is built with [Gulp][gulp] and hosted on [Google App Engine][gae] at http://ui.lumapps.com. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, install the [Python SDK of Google App Engine][gaepython].
2. In your environment, declare the variable `APPENGINE` with the path to your Google App Engine binaries.
For example, using bash in a Unix system with the default path will need to edit the `.bashrc` in your home to add:
    ```bash
    export APPENGINE=/home/USER/google-cloud-sdk/bin/
    ```
